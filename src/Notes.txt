MIME Types (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions)
---------------------------------------------------

1. Def.: These types are used by browser and server to identify the content
2. List of MIME types: 
- text/<doc_type> 			- e.g.: HTML, PDF, etc.
- image/<image_type> 		- e.g.: jpg, bmp, jpeg, etc.
- application/<type> 		- e.g.: msword, vnd-ms-excel, etc.

- More can be searched on Google. For any type of application file, there is a MIME type.
- Default is text/HTML, but for other types - plugins need to be installed.

3. To change MIME type: 

public abstract void ServletResponse.setContentType(String);

(called inside 'Servlet.service()')

4. For images, it is good to use byte-streams, instead of character streams.
